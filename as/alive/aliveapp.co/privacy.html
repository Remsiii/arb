                                            not located in the United States. The Personal Data that we collect from you
                                            will be stored in the United States and might also be shared with
                                            third-party data recipients (e.g. e-commerce and logistics providers and

                                            America. Therefore, the Personal Data that you provide to us may be

                                            privacy laws, we take measures to protect your Personal Data as described in
                                            this Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable Data Privacy Law. We
                                            also require all third-party data recipients (including our service
                                            providers) to process your information in a secure manner and in accordance
                                            with the applicable Data Privacy Law. If you have further questions about

                                        <p><strong>4.3 Retention of your Personal Data.</strong></p>
                                        <p>We will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the
                                            purposes for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate
                                            retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
                                            personal data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can

                                        <p>In general, this means that we will likely keep your Personal Data for as

                                            however, we may still retain your Personal Data so that we can maintain a

                                            again, and to comply with our internal processes and any legal obligations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When we no longer need your personal data, we will securely delete or destroy
                                            it. We will also consider if and how we can minimize over time the personal
                                            data that we use, and if we can anonymize your personal data so that it can
                                            no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use
                                            that information without further notice to you.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Request information</strong> about whether we hold personal
                                                information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we
                                                are holding/using it;</li>
                                            <li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly
                                                known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a
                                                copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we

                                            <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we
                                                hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate

                                                enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where
                                                there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
                                                the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where
                                                you have exercised your right to object to processing (see (e) below);

                                                we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
                                                there is something about your particular situation which makes you want
                                                to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to
                                                object where we are processing your personal information for direct
                                                marketing purposes;</li>

                                            <li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
                                                information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of
                                                personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish
                                                its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</li>

                                                known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your
                                                data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to
                                                transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format;

                                                you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and
                                                transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have
                                                the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any
                                                time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your
                                                consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or
                                                purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper

                                            Data or to exercise any of your other statutory rights, we may charge a

                                        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
                                            identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any
                                            of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal

                                        <p>The Alive App may provide links to other websites for your convenience and
                                            information. These websites may operate independently from us. If you visit
                                            any website linked to the Alive App, you are subject to that website’s or

                                            extent any linked websites are not owned or controlled by us, we are not

                                            practices of the websites.</p>
                                        <p><strong>8. Updates to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                                        <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide
                                            to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so
                                            that our users and customers are always aware of what information we

                                            account). Otherwise, we will use and disclose our users’ and customer’s
                                            Personal Data in agreement with the Privacy Policy that was in effect when
                                            the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of the Alive
                                            App after any change to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance
                                            of such change.</p>
